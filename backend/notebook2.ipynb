AI aims to simulate human intelligence, encompassing learning, inference, and reasoning. Machine learning, a subset of AI, involves algorithms learning from data to make predictions and identify patterns, useful in fields like cybersecurity. Deep learning, another subset, uses neural networks to mimic brain functions, though its complexity can make outcomes unpredictable. The video also highlights the rise of generative AI, including large language models and deep fakes, which generate new content by predicting sequences of words, audio, or video. These advancements, particularly foundation models, have significantly accelerated AI adoption, making it a pervasive technology. The speaker emphasizes understanding these technologies to harness their benefits effectively.', 'quiz': [{'question': 'Which AI technology is primarily responsible for generating new content?', 'options': ['Machine Learning', 'Deep Learning', 'Generative AI', 'Expert Systems'], 'answer': 'Generative AI'}, {'question': 'What is a key characteristic of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning?', 'options': ['Requires less data', 'Uses neural networks with multiple layers', 'Easier to interpret results', 'Relies on rule-based systems'], 'answer': 'Uses neural networks with multiple layers'}, {'question': 'How do large language models differ from traditional AI models?', 'options': ['They predict entire documents, not just words', 'They require less computational power', 'They are rule-based', 'They are less accurate'], 'answer': 'They predict entire documents, not just words'}], 'youtube_link': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYNweeDHiyU'}\n",

different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by complexity and value okay so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics so this is really about what is happening in my business right and it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening so a a good question we could ask here is well did sales go up or down the next level is diagnostic analytics and this is more about why did something happen so why did sales go up or down and it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem now the next one that we have is predictive analytics so this is about what is likely to happen next right so what will our sales performance be next quarter and it involves using historical patterns in our uh in our data to predict outcomes in the future and then finally we have prescriptive analytics so this is about what do i need to do next what is the recommended best action for a particular outcome so question we could ask here is what do i need to do to improve sales by 10 right okay so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it so let's look at the data science life cycle and the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding so this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative and this is where you can see the having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions okay so once we've defined that we can move on to data mining so this is this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis so once we've done that we can move on to data cleaning so the the reality of the marketplace is that once we when we find data it's probably not in the best format that we need it in and it probably has uh some some issues with it right it might have rows that have missing values it might have duplicates in it so there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's there's some overlap between the roles and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles and what you also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning they have to help out with exploration data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own so there's a lot of overlap and these different roles must collaborate with each other okay so i hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data turn it into knowledge and insights and then turn it into meaningful action for our business thank you

Transcript Video dari Youtube tersebut: let's talk about data science and some of the other related terms you may have heard such as predictive analytics machine learning advanced analytics and others so let's start with the textbook definition of data science so data science is the field of study that that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take okay so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science so really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by complexity and value okay so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics so this is really about what is happening in my business right and it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening so a a good question we could ask here is well did sales go up or down the next level is diagnostic analytics and this is more about why did something happen so why did sales go up or down and it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem now the next one that we have is predictive analytics so this is about what is likely to happen next right so what will our sales performance be next quarter and it involves using historical patterns in our uh in our data to predict outcomes in the future and then finally we have prescriptive analytics so this is about what do i need to do next what is the recommended best action for a particular outcome so question we could ask here is what do i need to do to improve sales by 10 right okay so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it so let's look at the data science life cycle and the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding so this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative and this is where you can see the having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions okay so once we've defined that we can move on to data mining so this is this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis so once we've done that we can move on to data cleaning so the the reality of the marketplace is that once we when we find data it's probably not in the best format that we need it in and it probably has uh some some issues with it right it might have rows that have missing values it might have duplicates in it so there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's there's some overlap between the roles and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles and what you also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning they have to help out with exploration data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own so there's a lot of overlap and these different roles must collaborate with each other okay so i hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data turn it into knowledge and insights and then turn it into meaningful action for our business thank you if you have questions please drop us a line below and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like and subscribe\", name='retrieve',

Transcript Video dari Youtube tersebut: let's talk about data science and some of the other related terms you may have heard such as predictive analytics machine learning advanced analytics and others so let's start with the textbook definition of data science so data science is the field of study that that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take okay so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science so really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by complexity and value okay so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics so this is really about what is happening in my business right and it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening so a a good question we could ask here is well did sales go up or down the next level is diagnostic analytics and this is more about why did something happen so why did sales go up or down and it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem now the next one that we have is predictive analytics so this is about what is likely to happen next right so what will our sales performance be next quarter and it involves using historical patterns in our uh in our data to predict outcomes in the future and then finally we have prescriptive analytics so this is about what do i need to do next what is the recommended best action for a particular outcome so question we could ask here is what do i need to do to improve sales by 10 right okay so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it so let's look at the data science life cycle and the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding so this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative and this is where you can see the having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions okay so once we've defined that we can move on to data mining so this is this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis so once we've done that we can move on to data cleaning so the the reality of the marketplace is that once we when we find data it's probably not in the best format that we need it in and it probably has uh some some issues with it right it might have rows that have missing values it might have duplicates in it so there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's

Transcript Video dari Youtube tersebut: let's talk about data science and some of the other related terms you may have heard such as predictive analytics machine learning advanced analytics and others so let's start with the textbook definition of data science so data science is the field of study that that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take okay so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science so really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by complexity and value okay so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics so this is really about what is happening in my business right and it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening so a a good question we could ask here is well did sales go up or down the next level is diagnostic analytics and this is more about why did something happen so why did sales go up or down and it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem now the next one that we have is predictive analytics so this is about what is likely to happen next right so what will our sales performance be next quarter and it involves using historical patterns in our uh in our data to predict outcomes in the future and then finally we have prescriptive analytics so this is about what do i need to do next what is the recommended best action for a particular outcome so question we could ask here is what do i need to do to improve sales by 10 right okay so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it so let's look at the data science life cycle and the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding so this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative and this is where you can see the having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions okay so once we've defined that we can move on to data mining so this is this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis so once we've done that we can move on to data cleaning so the the reality of the marketplace is that once we when we find data it's probably not in the best format that we need it in and it probably has uh some some issues with it right it might have rows that have missing values it might have duplicates in it so there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's there's some overlap between the roles and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles and what you also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning they have to help out with exploration data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own so there's a lot of overlap and these different roles must collaborate with each other okay so i hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data turn it into knowledge and insights and then turn it into meaningful action for our business thank you if you have questions please drop us a line below and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like and subscribe\", name='retrieve',

about data science and some of the other related terms you may have heard such as predictive analytics machine learning advanced analytics and others so let's start with the textbook definition of data science so data science is the field of study that that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take okay so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science so really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by complexity and value okay so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics so this is really about what is happening in my business right and it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening so a a good question we could ask here is well did sales go up or down the next level is diagnostic analytics and this is more about why did something happen so why did sales go up or down and it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem now the next one that we have is predictive analytics so this is about what is likely to happen next right so what will our sales performance be next quarter and it involves using historical patterns in our uh in our data to predict outcomes in the future and then finally we have prescriptive analytics so this is about what do i need to do next what is the recommended best action for a particular outcome so question we could ask here is what do i need to do to improve sales by 10 right okay so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it so let's look at the data science life cycle and the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding so this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative and this is where you can see the having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions okay so once we've defined that we can move on to data mining so this is this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis so once we've done that we can move on to data cleaning so the the reality of the marketplace is that once we when we find data it's probably not in the best format that we need it in and it probably has uh some some issues with it right it might have rows that have missing values it might have duplicates in it so there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's there's some overlap between the roles and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles and what you also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning they have to help out with exploration data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own so there's a lot of overlap and these different roles must collaborate with each other okay so i hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data turn it into knowledge and insights and then turn it into meaningful action for our business thank you

But what\\'s the one thing that underpins all of these revolutionary Technologies? The answer is data. From social media to the iot devices for generating. Bill amount of data consider the cab service provider Uber. I\\'m sure all of you have used Uber. What are you think makes Uber a multi-billion dollar worth company. Is it that availability of cabs or is it their service? Well, the answer is data data makes them very rich, but wait, is there enough to grow a business? Of course, it isn\\'t you must know how to use the data to draw useful insights and solve problems. This is where data science comes in in. Words data science is the process of using data to find Solutions or to predict outcomes for a problem statement to better understand data science. Let\\'s see how it affects our day-to-day activities. It\\'s a Monday morning and I have to get to office before my meeting starts. So I quickly open up Uber and look for cabs, but there\\'s something unusual the gab reads A comparatively higher at this hour of the day. Why does this happen? Well, obviously because Monday mornings are P cars and everyone is rushing off to work. Work the high demand for cams leads to increase in the cab fares. We all know this but how is all of this implemented data science is at the heart of Ubers pricing algorithm The Surge pricing algorithm ensures that their passengers always get a ride when they need one. Even if it comes at the cost of inflated prices Uber implements data science to find out which neighborhoods will be the busiest so that it can activate search pricing to get more drivers on the road in this manner over maximized. The number of rides it can provide and hence benefit from this Uber surge pricing algorithm uses data science. Let\\'s see how a data science process always begins with understanding the business requirement or the problem. You\\'re trying to solve in this case. The business requirement is to build a dynamic pricing model that takes effect. When a lot of people in the same area are requesting rides at the same time. This is followed by data collection Uber collects data such as the weather. Oracle data holidays time traffic pick up and drop location and it keeps a track of all of this. The next stage is data cleaning while sometimes unnecessary data is collected such data only increases the complexity of the problem an example is boober might collect information like the location of restaurants and cafes nearby now such data is not needed to analyze Uber surge pricing there for such data has to be removed at this step data planning is followed by date. Exploration and Analysis. The data exploration stage is like the brainstorming of data analysis. This is where you understand the patterns in your data. This is followed by data modeling the data modeling stage basically includes building a machine learning model that predicts the Uber surge at a given time and location. This model is built by using all the insights and Trends collected in the exploration stage. The model is trained by feeding at thousands of customer records, so that it can Learn to predict the outcome more precisely. Next is the data validation stage now here the model is tested when a new customer books arrive the data of the new booking is compared with the historic data in order to check if there are any anomalies in the search prices or any false predictions, if any such anomalies are detected a notification is immediately sent to the data scientists at Uber who fix the issue. This is how Uber predicts a surge price for a given location and time the final stage of The science is deployment and optimization. So after testing the model and improving its efficiency, it is deployed on all the users at this stage customer feedback is received and if there are any issues, they are fixed here. So that was the entire data science process. Now, let\\'s look at a few other applications of data science data science is implemented in e-commerce platforms, like Amazon and Flipkart. It is also the logic behind Netflix\\'s recommendation system now in all actuality Qu ality data science has made remarkable changes in today\\'s market. It\\'s applications range from credit card fraud detection to self-driving cars and virtual assistant such as City and Alexa. Let\\'s consider an example suppose you look for shoes on Amazon, but you do not buy it then in there. Now the next day you\\'re watching videos on YouTube and suddenly you see an ad for the same item you switch to Facebook there. Also, you see the same ad so how does this happen? Well this Happens because Google Tracks your search history and recommends ads based on your search history. This is one of the coolest applications of data science. In fact 35% of Amazon\\'s revenue is generated by product recommendation. And the logic behind product recommendation is data science. Let me tell you another sad story Scott killed in never imagined his Apple watch might save his life, but that\\'s exactly what happened a few months ago when he had a heart attack in the middle of the night. But how could a watch detect a heart attack any guesses? Well, it\\'s data science again. Apple used data science to build a watch that monitors and individuals Health this watch collects data such as the person\\'s heart rate sleep cycle breathing rate activity level blood pressure Etc and keeps a record of these measures 24 bars seven. This collected data is then processed and analyzed to build a model that predicts the risk of a heart attack. So these were a few hours Locations now the question is how and why you should become a data scientist according to linkedin\\'s March 2019 survey a data scientist is the most promising job role in the US and it stands at number one on glass doors best jobs of 2019. Here are a couple of job trends that are collected from LinkedIn top companies like Microsoft IBM Facebook and Google have over thousand job vacancies, and this number is only going to grow. Hurley these job Trends show the vacancy of jobs with respect to jog defame coming to the salary of a data scientist the average salary ranges between a hundred thousand dollars two hundred and eighty two thousand dollars. Now remember that your salary varies on your skills your level of experience your geography and the company you\\'re working for here are the skills that are needed to become a data scientist. You must be skilled in statistics expertise in programming languages like our and python is a Just you\\'re required to have a good understanding of processes, like data extraction processing wrangling and exploration.

there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's there's some overlap between the roles and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles and what you also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning they have to help out with exploration data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own so there's a lot of overlap and these different roles must collaborate with each other okay so i hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data turn it into knowledge and insights and then turn it into meaningful action for our business thank you if you have questions please drop us a line below and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like and subscribe\"),\n",

Are they the  same thing? Well, you may have seen these terms\\xa0\\xa0 used interchangeably, but if I'm mining data from\\xa0 a large dataset, am I performing data science or\\xa0\\xa0 am I performing data analytics? Or what if I'm\\xa0 trying to create a prediction of when my store\\xa0\\xa0 will sell out of our current inventory of\\xa0 cantaloupes? Well, is that analytics or is\\xa0\\xa0 that science? It's worthwhile to understand the\\xa0 difference to better comprehend what these two\\xa0\\xa0 fields can do, and also, if you're considering\\xa0 a career in either field. After all, these are two\\xa0\\xa0 different jobs. Somebody who works in the field\\xa0 of data science is known as a data scientist.\\xa0\\xa0 For data analytics, that role is called a data\\xa0 analyst. Now, this is kind of a trick question\\xa0\\xa0 because we can classify everything-- data\\xa0 mining, data forecasting and all the rest of\\xa0\\xa0 it --as simply data science. And that's because\\xa0 data science is the overarching umbrella term\\xa0\\xa0 that covers tasks related to finding patterns in\\xa0 large datasets, training machine learning models,\\xa0\\xa0 and deploying AI applications. Data analytics, it\\xa0 could be argued, is one task that resides under\\xa0\\xa0 the data science umbrella. It's a specialization\\xa0 of data science, and it focuses on querying,\\xa0\\xa0 interpreting and visualizing datasets. Data\\xa0 science is iterative, meaning data scientists form\\xa0\\xa0 hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired\\xa0 outcome can be achieved using available data.\\xa0\\xa0 And that is a process that is known as the data\\xa0 science lifecycle, which usually follows seven\\xa0\\xa0 phases. So first is to identify a problem or an\\xa0 opportunity. Then the next phase is data mining,\\xa0\\xa0 which is to extract data relevant to that problem\\xa0 or opportunity from large datasets. Now that data\\xa0\\xa0 will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies\\xa0 and errors, which is fixed in the next stage,\\xa0\\xa0 data cleaning. And then at that point, we move on\\xa0 to data exploration analysis to try to make sense\\xa0\\xa0 of that data. We'll then apply feature engineering\\xa0 using domain knowledge to extract details from the\\xa0\\xa0 data. And predictive modeling comes next to use\\xa0 the data to predict or forecast future outcomes\\xa0\\xa0 and behaviors. And then finally, we have data\\xa0 visualization that represents the data points with\\xa0\\xa0 graphical tools such as charts and animations.\\xa0 And so the lifecycle repeats. Now, the role of a\\xa0\\xa0 data scientist is an in-demand profession right\\xa0 now. If that's something you're interested in,\\xa0\\xa0 you'll want to develop deep skills in machine\\xa0 learning and AI. It's helpful to be able to\\xa0\\xa0 write code in languages such as Python--also in R--\\xa0 it's another popular language for data science. And\\xa0\\xa0 you should have experience working with big data\\xa0 platforms. So perhaps Hadoop or Apache Spark. And\\xa0\\xa0 it's also very helpful to have database knowledge\\xa0 and SQL. So that's data science. But what about\\xa0\\xa0 its specialization, data analytics? Well, the job\\xa0 of a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set\\xa0\\xa0 as it currently exists. So we have some data\\xa0 here and we need to do something with it. And\\xa0\\xa0 we need to be able to make decisions based on\\xa0 this data. How do we conceptualize it? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 four ways. One is through predictive analytics,\\xa0 which helps to identify trends, correlations and\\xa0\\xa0 causation within datasets like forecasting when\\xa0 those cantaloupes would have all flown off the\\xa0\\xa0 shelves. Or, in health care, to forecast regions\\xa0 which will experience a rise in flu cases. There's\\xa0\\xa0 prescriptive analytics, and that predicts likely\\xa0 outcomes and makes decision recommendations like\\xa0\\xa0 predicting when a tire will wear out and need\\xa0 to be replaced. There's diagnostic analytics\\xa0\\xa0 that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred.\\xa0 Manufacturers can analyze a failed component on an\\xa0\\xa0 assembly line and figure out the reason behind its\\xa0 failure. And then there is descriptive analytics\\xa0\\xa0 which evaluates the qualities and quantities of\\xa0 a data set. A content streaming provider might\\xa0\\xa0 use descriptive analytics to understand how many\\xa0 subscribers it's lost or how many it's gained over\\xa0\\xa0 a given period of time and what content is being\\xa0 watched. And while a data scientist is a clearly\\xa0\\xa0 defined and specialized role, virtually any\\xa0 stakeholder can be a data analyst. For example,\\xa0\\xa0 business analysts can use BI dashboards to conduct\\xa0 business analytics and visualize KPIs. But many\\xa0\\xa0 organizations do employ professional, dedicated\\xa0 data analysts, responsible for data wrangling\\xa0\\xa0 and interpreting findings like why a company's\\xa0 marketing campaign didn't meet expectations. If\\xa0\\xa0 you want to be a data analyst, it helps to have\\xa0 both analytical and programming skills. So this\\xa0\\xa0 includes familiarity with databases. Also, you'll\\xa0 need to know about statistical analysis. And also\\xa0\\xa0 data visualization is another important skill.\\xa0 So data analytics is often more focused on using\\xa0\\xa0 statistical tools and techniques to interpret\\xa0 existing data and offer actionable insights.\\xa0\\xa0 It's usually less concerned with creating\\xa0 new algorithms or models. Data science,\\xa0\\xa0 on the other hand, has a broader scope that can\\xa0 involve complex machine learning algorithms, often\\xa0\\xa0 created from scratch. Data science focuses\\xa0 on phases from data collection to predictive\\xa0\\xa0 modeling. Data analysis, on the other hand, is\\xa0 more about answering specific questions with\\xa0\\xa0 that data. And if you've done both your\\xa0 data science and data analytics right,\\xa0\\xa0 you'll always be able to keep cantaloupes\\xa0 and just about everything else in stock.\")]"

related terms you may have heard such as predictive analytics machine learning advanced analytics and others so let's start with the textbook definition of data science so data science is the field of study that that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take okay so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science so really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by complexity and value okay so the first one that we have here is descriptive analytics so this is really about what is happening in my business right and it involves having accurate data collection to make sure that we know what's happening so a a good question we could ask here is well did sales go up or down the next level is diagnostic analytics and this is more about why did something happen so why did sales go up or down and it involves drilling down to the root cause of our problem now the next one that we have is predictive analytics so this is about what is likely to happen next right so what will our sales performance be next quarter and it involves using historical patterns in our uh in our data to predict outcomes in the future and then finally we have prescriptive analytics so this is about what do i need to do next what is the recommended best action for a particular outcome so question we could ask here is what do i need to do to improve sales by 10 right okay so now we can talk about how data science is done and who actually does it so let's look at the data science life cycle and the first thing that we always must start with is business understanding so this is really critical to make sure that we're asking the right question before we go down a lengthy data science initiative and this is where you can see the having the business expertise and the domain expertise can be incredibly critical to make sure that we're asking the right questions okay so once we've defined that we can move on to data mining so this is this is the process of actually going out into our data landscape and procuring the data that we need for our analysis so once we've done that we can move on to data cleaning so the the reality of the marketplace is that once we when we find data it's probably not in the best format that we need it in and it probably has uh some some issues with it right it might have rows that have missing values it might have duplicates in it so there's some preparation and cleaning that we have to do before it's ready for our analysis so once we've done that cleansing we can move on to exploration okay so this is the part of the process that allows us to use different analytical tools that can start helping us answer some of the the types of questions that i mentioned here earlier and if we actually want to get into some of these higher value questions like predictive and prescriptive then we must start using advanced analytical tools such as machine learning tools that leverage massive amounts of computing power and massive amounts of high quality data to make predictions and prescribe actions for the future now once we've done our exploration and perhaps our advanced analytics what do we do next well we need to visualize our insights and outcomes of our analysis okay now i want to quickly touch on who does what in this life cycle so in an organization you may have roles like a business analyst you might have data engineers and then you might have data scientists so business analysts are obviously involved in formulating the questions they have the domain expertise they can help with the business understanding but they're also involved with visualizing our insights in a way that's useful for the business right and then we have folks like data engineering folks so these are the people that can help us find the data clean the data and then also help with some of the exploration we move on to our data scientists so these are the people that will really help us with the exploration they'll help us with the advanced machine learning techniques and they'll also assist in the visualization so you can see there's there's some overlap between the roles and that's why it's critical to have collaboration across these roles and what you also start seeing nowadays in the marketplace is that sometimes business analysts have to do some machine learning they have to help out with exploration data scientists sometimes need to go and find the data on their own so there's a lot of overlap and these different roles must collaborate with each other okay so i hope you can see now how the data science life cycle can help us take noisy data turn it into knowledge and insights and then turn it into meaningful action for our business thank you if you have questions please drop us a line below

Are they the  same thing? Well, you may have seen these terms\\xa0\\xa0 used interchangeably, but if I'm mining data from\\xa0 a large dataset, am I performing data science or\\xa0\\xa0 am I performing data analytics? Or what if I'm\\xa0 trying to create a prediction of when my store\\xa0\\xa0 will sell out of our current inventory of\\xa0 cantaloupes? Well, is that analytics or is\\xa0\\xa0 that science? It's worthwhile to understand the\\xa0 difference to better comprehend what these two\\xa0\\xa0 fields can do, and also, if you're considering\\xa0 a career in either field. After all, these are two\\xa0\\xa0 different jobs. Somebody who works in the field\\xa0 of data science is known as a data scientist.\\xa0\\xa0 For data analytics, that role is called a data\\xa0 analyst. Now, this is kind of a trick question\\xa0\\xa0 because we can classify everything-- data\\xa0 mining, data forecasting and all the rest of\\xa0\\xa0 it --as simply data science. And that's because\\xa0 data science is the overarching umbrella term\\xa0\\xa0 that covers tasks related to finding patterns in\\xa0 large datasets, training machine learning models,\\xa0\\xa0 and deploying AI applications. Data analytics, it\\xa0 could be argued, is one task that resides under\\xa0\\xa0 the data science umbrella. It's a specialization\\xa0 of data science, and it focuses on querying,\\xa0\\xa0 interpreting and visualizing datasets. Data\\xa0 science is iterative, meaning data scientists form\\xa0\\xa0 hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired\\xa0 outcome can be achieved using available data.\\xa0\\xa0 And that is a process that is known as the data\\xa0 science lifecycle, which usually follows seven\\xa0\\xa0 phases. So first is to identify a problem or an\\xa0 opportunity. Then the next phase is data mining,\\xa0\\xa0 which is to extract data relevant to that problem\\xa0 or opportunity from large datasets. Now that data\\xa0\\xa0 will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies\\xa0 and errors, which is fixed in the next stage,\\xa0\\xa0 data cleaning. And then at that point, we move on\\xa0 to data exploration analysis to try to make sense\\xa0\\xa0 of that data. We'll then apply feature engineering\\xa0 using domain knowledge to extract details from the\\xa0\\xa0 data. And predictive modeling comes next to use\\xa0 the data to predict or forecast future outcomes\\xa0\\xa0 and behaviors. And then finally, we have data\\xa0 visualization that represents the data points with\\xa0\\xa0 graphical tools such as charts and animations.\\xa0 And so the lifecycle repeats. Now, the role of a\\xa0\\xa0 data scientist is an in-demand profession right\\xa0 now. If that's something you're interested in,\\xa0\\xa0 you'll want to develop deep skills in machine\\xa0 learning and AI. It's helpful to be able to\\xa0\\xa0 write code in languages such as Python--also in R--\\xa0 it's another popular language for data science. And\\xa0\\xa0 you should have experience working with big data\\xa0 platforms. So perhaps Hadoop or Apache Spark. And\\xa0\\xa0 it's also very helpful to have database knowledge\\xa0 and SQL. So that's data science. But what about\\xa0\\xa0 its specialization, data analytics? Well, the job\\xa0 of a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set\\xa0\\xa0 as it currently exists. So we have some data\\xa0 here and we need to do something with it. And\\xa0\\xa0 we need to be able to make decisions based on\\xa0 this data. How do we conceptualize it? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 four ways. One is through predictive analytics,\\xa0 which helps to identify trends, correlations and\\xa0\\xa0 causation within datasets like forecasting when\\xa0 those cantaloupes would have all flown off the\\xa0\\xa0 shelves. Or, in health care, to forecast regions\\xa0 which will experience a rise in flu cases. There's\\xa0\\xa0 prescriptive analytics, and that predicts likely\\xa0 outcomes and makes decision recommendations like\\xa0\\xa0 predicting when a tire will wear out and need\\xa0 to be replaced. There's diagnostic analytics\\xa0\\xa0 that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred.\\xa0 Manufacturers can analyze a failed component on an\\xa0\\xa0 assembly line and figure out the reason behind its\\xa0 failure. And then there is descriptive analytics\\xa0\\xa0 which evaluates the qualities and quantities of\\xa0 a data set. A content streaming provider might\\xa0\\xa0 use descriptive analytics to understand how many\\xa0 subscribers it's lost or how many it's gained over\\xa0\\xa0 a given period of time and what content is being\\xa0 watched. And while a data scientist is a clearly\\xa0\\xa0 defined and specialized role, virtually any\\xa0 stakeholder can be a data analyst. For example,\\xa0\\xa0 business analysts can use BI dashboards to conduct\\xa0 business analytics and visualize KPIs. But many\\xa0\\xa0 organizations do employ professional, dedicated\\xa0 data analysts, responsible for data wrangling\\xa0\\xa0 and interpreting findings like why a company's\\xa0 marketing campaign didn't meet expectations. If\\xa0\\xa0 you want to be a data analyst, it helps to have\\xa0 both analytical and programming skills. So this\\xa0\\xa0 includes familiarity with databases. Also, you'll\\xa0 need to know about statistical analysis. And also\\xa0\\xa0 data visualization is another important skill.\\xa0 So data analytics is often more focused on using\\xa0\\xa0 statistical tools and techniques to interpret\\xa0 existing data and offer actionable insights.\\xa0\\xa0 It's usually less concerned with creating\\xa0 new algorithms or models. Data science,\\xa0\\xa0 on the other hand, has a broader scope that can\\xa0 involve complex machine learning algorithms, often\\xa0\\xa0 created from scratch. Data science focuses\\xa0 on phases from data collection to predictive\\xa0\\xa0 modeling. Data analysis, on the other hand, is\\xa0 more about answering specific questions with\\xa0\\xa0 that data. And if you've done both your\\xa0 data science and data analytics right,\\xa0\\xa0 you'll always be able to keep cantaloupes\\xa0 and just about everything else in stock.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSUwFGa6Fk'}, page_content=\"Ini adalah Pembelajaran Tentang/Topik Tentang: Key Concepts in Data Science \\n\\nIni adalah Summary/Ringkasan tentang topik tersebut: Data science is the field focused on extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data to inform business actions.

related terms you may have heard such as predictive analytics machine learning advanced analytics and others so let's start with the textbook definition of data science so data science is the field of study that that involves extracting knowledge and insights from noisy data and then turning those insights into actions that our business or organization can take okay so let's dig into it a little bit more and discuss what are the different areas that are covered by data science so really data science is the intersection between three different disciplines we start with computer science then we also cover the area of mathematics and then what i think is the most important is business expertise so the intersection of these three disciplines is data science and true data science initiatives involve collaboration across all these three different areas okay so now let's touch on the different types of data science that you can do now what we need to understand here is that we have different data science methods for different questions that we might ask in an organization and these questions can vary by complexity and the value that we get out of them so let's chart them here by
